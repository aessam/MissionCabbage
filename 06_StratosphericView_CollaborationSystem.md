# Stratospheric View: Collaboration System

## Purpose

The Collaboration System enables real-time multi-user editing, allowing multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously. It provides presence awareness, synchronized editing, communication channels, and shared context to create a seamless collaborative coding experience.

## Core Concepts

### Real-time Collaboration

- **Operational Transformation (OT)**: Algorithm for conflict resolution
- **Presence**: Indication of other users and their activities
- **Synchronization**: Keeping editor state consistent across clients
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handling simultaneous edits
- **Permissions**: Access control for collaborative sessions

### Communication Channels

- **Text Chat**: Instant messaging between collaborators
- **Voice Calls**: Real-time audio communication
- **Screen Sharing**: Sharing visual workspace
- **Channels**: Persistent group communication spaces
- **Notifications**: Alerts for important events

### Collaboration Units

- **Room**: A collaborative editing session
- **Participant**: A user in a collaborative session
- **Channel**: A persistent collaboration space
- **Project**: A collaborative codebase
- **Message**: Communication unit between users

### Networking

- **Server Connection**: Connection to collaboration server
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Direct connections between clients
- **WebRTC**: Protocol for real-time communication
- **Reconnection**: Handling network interruptions
- **State Synchronization**: Ensuring consistent state

### Identity and Access

- **User Profiles**: Identity information for users
- **Authentication**: Verifying user identity
- **Presence Status**: User availability information
- **Permissions**: Access control settings
- **Invitations**: Adding users to collaborative sessions

## Architecture

### Core Components

   - Handles synchronization of document changes
   - Processes presence information
   - Manages authentication and identity

2. **Channel System**
   - Maintains list of available channels
   - Handles channel membership
   - Processes channel messages
   - Manages channel-specific settings
   - Provides channel history

3. **Call Manager**
   - Establishes voice connections
   - Handles audio streams
   - Manages call participants
   - Provides call status information
   - Controls screen sharing

4. **Presence System**
   - Tracks user presence
   - Updates cursor positions

   - Provides selection visibility

5. **Synchronization Engine**
   - Implements document synchronization
   - Resolves edit conflicts
   - Manages version history
   - Handles state reconciliation
   - Provides offline support

### Data Flow

1. **Edit Synchronization Flow**
   - Local edit occurs
   - Edit is transformed into operations
   - Operations are sent to collaboration server
   - Server broadcasts to other participants
   - Other clients apply the operations
   - UI updates to reflect changes

2. **Presence Update Flow**
   - Local cursor moves or selection changes
   - Change is captured as presence update
   - Update is sent to collaboration server
   - Server broadcasts to other participants
   - Other clients render the presence information
   - UI shows other users' positions

3. **Communication Flow**
   - User sends a message
   - Message is transmitted to server
   - Server delivers to recipients
   - Recipients receive notification
   - Message appears in conversation
   - History is updated

4. **Connection Flow**
   - User connects to collaboration server
   - Authentication is performed
   - User state is synchronized
   - Presence is established
   - Available channels are listed
   - User joins appropriate channels

## Swift Considerations

### Real-time Collaboration Implementation

- Consider using Swift's Combine for reactive programming
- Implement Operational Transformation in pure Swift
- Use Swift's strong typing for operation types
- Consider actors for thread-safe collaboration state

### Communication Integration

- Use AVFoundation for audio processing
- Consider using WebRTC or a similar framework for calls
- Implement chat using Swift's network stack
- Use Apple's push notification service for notifications

### Network Layer

- Use URLSession for HTTP communication
- Consider using WebSockets for real-time updates
- Implement robust reconnection logic
- Use Swift's Result type for network operations

### User Interface

- Use SwiftUI for presence indicators
- Consider custom views for collaborative editing
- Implement cursor and selection visualization
- Design thread-safe UI updates

### Security Implementation

- Use Apple's encryption frameworks
- Implement secure authentication
- Consider App Transport Security requirements
- Use secure storage for credentials

## Key Implementation Patterns

1. **Conflict-free Replicated Data Types**: Consider CRDTs as an alternative to OT
2. **Replication Protocol**: Clear protocol for data replication
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Apply local changes immediately, then reconcile
4. **Version Vectors**: Track document versions for synchronization
5. **Delta Encoding**: Only transmit changes, not full documents
6. **Presence Broadcasting**: Efficient sharing of user activity
7. **Voice Optimization**: Audio processing for clear communication

## Performance Considerations

1. **Operation Batching**: Group small operations for efficiency
2. **Incremental Sync**: Only synchronize changed portions
3. **Bandwidth Management**: Optimize data usage for collaboration
4. **Message Compression**: Reduce size of transmitted data
5. **Background Synchronization**: Perform heavy sync in background
6. **Presence Throttling**: Limit frequency of presence updates
7. **Connection Quality Adaptation**: Adjust behavior based on network

## Next Steps

After understanding the Collaboration System, we'll examine the Extension System, which enables customization and extension of Zed's functionality. This includes plugin architecture, API surface, and extension capabilities that allow users to tailor the editor to their specific needs.
